# Firmware dependencies

The firmware requires the following libraries:

- PWMServer
- RoboClaw

To install the RoboClaw library for use with a Teensy board in the Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

**Download the RoboClaw Arduino Library**

Obtain the RoboClaw Arduino library as a .zip file. This is typically available from the Basicmicro resources website.

**Open the Arduino IDE**

Launch the Arduino Integrated Development Environment on your computer.

**Add the .Zip Library**

- In the Arduino IDE, navigate to the top menu.
- Click on Sketch.
- Select Include Library.
- Choose Add .Zip Library....

**Select the Downloaded Library**

A dialog box will appear. Browse to the location where you saved the downloaded RoboClaw library .zip file, select it, and then click Open.

**Verification**

The Arduino IDE will now add the library to your installation. You can verify the installation by going to Sketch > Include Library again and checking if "RoboClaw" appears in the list of available libraries.
